Obviously another scammer as she mistakenly said her name was karen, deleted the text and corrected her mistake. She then sent me a link for the ""platform"" to do the food review job mentioned. It was the usual ""do a few reviews, after 30-33 reviews, you can cash out"". The caveat being you need to deposit money to continue after the initial few reviews. After the whole fiasco, she added me to a telegram group called enjoy life with another ""newbie"". The newbie contacted me saying she was scared this was a scam and said she would ask someone to check whether it was a legitimate job. OF course the next day she said that after checking, it was legitimate without showing any evidence. This goes to show how far some people would go just to scam others of their own livelihood. I urge anyone who has received these types of job offers to verify with the relevant parties on whether this is a scam or not. No recruiters would solicit you unprofessionally using telegram/WhatsApp. I hope everyone continues to be safe and avoid scams such as this and inform your friends and family."

Jeong Jin woo,,"I suspect that I have been scammed by a man whom I met on instagram (instagram IDs: jin_woo_0001, jeo_jin212, telegram user ID: Chang_121, kakaotalk ID: 인생은 좋다) and identified himself as Jeong Jin Woo, a 31 year old petroleum engineer from Seoul, South Korea. He claimed that he lost both his parents when he was 12 and his birthday is on 19 October 1991. He also claimed that he worked for the Korea National Oil Corporation, and that he left his job one month after we met on Instagram to take up a personal oil rig contract with the Turkish Petroleum Corporation from February 2022 to early April 2022. Shortly after we chatted on Instagram (since 29 December 2021), he requested to move our chat to Telegram (since 31 December 2021). I found out that he was a scam when I recently did a reverse image search of the photos which he had been sending me on Telegram claiming to be of himself and found that they belong to a different person with a different identity on Instagram (instagram ID: jjangga777), after I was nearly duped by a related parcel scam (he tried to send me a parcel from Korea claiming it was for my birthday, and it apparently got stuck at customs and I was required to pay money to the agent before the parcel could be delivered to my doorstep. The transaction was fortunately blocked by my bank who called me to inform me of the scam.). He maintained his innocence even after I confronted him about it. What’s fishy is that he refused to share any other photos of himself not from jjangga777’s Instagram profile and was unable to do a private video call with me to prove his innocence (claiming that rig security forbids video calls). He even sent me a fake passport ID to ""proof his innocence"". However, by the time I found this out I had already transferred a total of $55,625 on various occasions to different bank accounts. On the first occasion, he claimed that he needed to pay the transport driver for the equipment he ordered otherwise his equipment would be stuck at the sea port."

Out of boredom and curiosity, I decided to play along. The website for the game is ui2c.xyz (not sure if it changes. Do not click). There are several ""games"" people can play as an investment and the initial deposit is low. There is a live help centre/customer service officers where people have to contact in order to load their accounts. All of which is operated in Mandarin. After contacting the help centre, we are provided with a bank account (not sure if it changes but this time was standard Chartered) where money can be deposited to load the account. Subsequently, after playing the ""game"" the players get to withdraw their earnings and it is deposited back using the same account. I am luckY i have not been monetarily affected and have since stopped contact with the scammer. Scams are rampant these days so please be careful when conversing with people online"

After creating the account, she told me to use her account first to complete the missions to get 20% commission into my new account. Then I’ll have to complete missions in my own account in order to withdraw all the commissions. So the job was to “click and submit data” but in order to click and submit, the account must have sufficient money to proceed with the order if not have to top up/recharge. To recharge, I had to contact the customer service WhatsApp number (65 88032130) and transfer money to the accounts provided. Yesterday (14/12) was to Chin Mei Yi, acc no. 7013563466 UOB, PayNow 6580146271. Today is to Loh Jia Le, acc no. 4303740338 UOB, PayNow 6587614013.

I top up a total of $580 already and I had to top up more so I asked Elise for help and she told me she wouldn’t help me and eventually stopped replying me on WhatsApp. With no help to complete the missions, I tried to get my money back. But when I contacted Customer Service, the person kept insisting I I try my best to finish all my missions and encouraged me to top up the amount needed in order to complete my missions and withdraw my money back and the commissions. That’s when I decided to contact the my bank (OCBC) to get my money back and make a police report."

I initially find it weird, why would they require such details to such extent. He convinced me he needed it to activate the OTP sent via SMS from the bank and I just have to read it. This way they need me to approve the transaction which he is making so he can stop the payment and reverse it back to my credit card. I am clueless in this and he convinced me. Then he went on to ask me how many other credit cards I possess as the hacker might also hack into my other cards under my name and made other transactions with Amazon. At first, I was thinking how would the hacker able to find my other credit cards under my name and I believed him and proceed to give all my other credit card details to him including the OTP messages pin that comes in.

I bought 5 pieces meant as gifts for friends and family. so what happened was that the items arrived, you would pay the courier in cash, and then when you inspect the items, they were clearly not originals (much less from the official store at changi airport) and of an inferior quality (like those on the street stalls of bangkok), with suspicious packaging. So naturally you would email the company and asked for a refund, but they would stall for time, claiming that they are transacting while an agent, and the agent will require 3-5 weeks to process the refund."

We proceeded to whatsapp (Mobile number 88021142) and spoke for 2 days and everything seems fine and she gained my trust that she is a legit potential date. she mentioned she is working a side job for zalora by helping  to make purchases in advance and receive 5% commission from the merchant. the commission and principal amount will be transferred be to me immediately after my transfer. she mentioned that she needs to complete 50 orders a day and appreciated that i could help her complete some of it. Finally, I agreed to help her out and was given another number by Judy she claimed was the ZALORA customer service. The first 3 jobs were small amount and I was given the refund and commission immediately. Then the issue comes when i was asked to transfer an amount for the item worth $1367. I made the transfer and this time the money was not returned to me. This time the customer service told me that I was supposed to transfer FOR 3 PIECES OF THE SAME item (total $4101) I believed the customer service and transfer the BALANCE amount ($1367 X 2 = $2734) BUT WAS TOLD THAT I DID NOT INFORM THEM BEFORE I TRANSFERRED AND THE SYSTEM DID NOT CAPTURE THE TRANSACTION.  I was told to transfer ANOTHER $2734 and CAME BACK SAYING THIS IS A DOUBLE ORDER AND I ONLY COMPLETED THE OTHER ORDER AND TRANSFERRED ANOTHER ($1367 X 3 = $4101) LASTLY THEY TOLD ME MY ACCOUNT IS FROZEN AND I NEED TO COMPLETE ANOTHER ORDER FOR A G-SHOCK WATCH THAT COST $4900 IN ORDER TO UNFREEZE THE ACCOUNT. BY THEN I  REALISED That I GOT SCAMMED and I made a trip down personally to the police station to report the case."

He said his Scotland bank account got locked and he needs to access it to get funds for the job he’s doing in Malaysia for Petronas. He said he needed a SG simcard for it but since he’s in Malaysia he’s asks me a favour to buy a sim card and send it to him. I was blinded by his sweet words and want to help I bought and sent it via FedEx. He said he needs to do top up. After doing the top up he said that its not working and asked me if it’s okay for me to lend some money which I said no. He called and got mad then said he’s just going to borrow money from his colleague Kim Wang and if it can be deposit to my bank account so I can send it to him because he really wants to finish his work asap as the covid there is high. He said the money is for him to buy materials for work and expenses in Malaysia. After transferring the money deposited to my account I received a call from the bank telling me that my online banking has been disabled and that a deposited cash to my account has been reported as a fraud. I was confused on what’s happening so I told the bank I will first check what’s happening. Harry Ronnie said that his colleague Wang didn’t reported anything and that he will ask Wang to go to the bank. He suddenly said his colleague transferred another money to my account and that I should send it to him via WU because he needed it to settle his workers payment. There’s an issue with the WU that I was not able to send him the money. He called, shouted and accused me of lying to him and taking interest on his money. This is also when I feel pressured and broke down crying because he’s accusing me. To prove to him that I’m not lying I borrow money from a colleague so the money can be sent to him. We got okay after the money has been transferred to him and he said that he’ll come back to Singapore by Sunday and asked if I can send him cash because he still needs to settle his workers payment and I told him that I can’t send him any cash. He showed me a CIMB cheque and a letter that he needs to pay the worker’s first before he can travel back to Singapore. I know it’s too late but this is when I realized that I’m being scammed so I called the police and ask what to do next as I’m really confused."

I started to feel suspicious as the background noise from his phone was very noisy and can hear other people talking. He sounds too aggressive to be a staff from Amazon. Straight after, he asked for my email address. I ask how I can verify he is calling from Amazon and ask why he need it when Amazon already has my email address. Scammer said he need me to verify my identity using my email address so that he can stop the transaction. I refused and my husband took over and told him we will call the credit company to cancel the transaction. He said that it is no use and the transaction will go through unless he verifies my email address. My husband asked him to send 2FA to my email address and told him off before he hung up on him.

You will be randomly assigned an item to buy, and it will be done automatically. however, the item purchased can go above the amount you deposit, so you may have to end up topping up the balance just to get back Your money and “commission” afterwards. (Items range from Cheap batteries to expensive jewellery) I previously made one transaction with my friend, and we profited $200 from it. So being greedy, we went ahead to top up the negative balance, when we were told our money was used to buy a more expensive item (top up was done through paynow)."

Police officer in charge has ask me to block hIs number. I dont really care about the lost of money, all i'm worried now is my safety & my family safety. This Has hit me hard & totally a lesson learnt. No licensed moneylender will take an upfront amount when applying for loan. Licensed moneylender would always deduct whatever admin fees through your loan amount. Please be careful and spread this awareness. I'm going to change my bank account number and contact number. Just hope that they won't harrass my next 2 kin and come to my house. Praying hard!"

I whatsapp him (HE NAMED HIMSELF ""NAYA"") and he said orders have to be directed to them as they are only using the shopee platform for advertisment. So after much convincing, i decided to trust him and transfer him $300 to his Malaysia acc (he claimed that their sg ocbc acc is down). He promised that the delivery will be the next day. The following day, he texted saying that they have run out of stock and will have to deliver from their malaysia store and that will cost another $300 for tax and insurance fees. I told him i can't pay so much, then he offered to help me pay $100 so i just needed to pay another $200, which will be refunded when they deliver the item. So i transfer another $200, but the item was not received on the same day. The following day (today), he claimed that their delivery van is spoiled, which caused the delay in delivery. He promised that the drone will be delivered today. After a while, he claimed that there is another issue and that will require me to transfer another $400 for stamp fees (WHICH HE CLAIMED WILL BE REFUNDED WHEN THE ITEM IS BEING DELIVERED). AT THIS POINT OF TIME, I KNEW it was a scam. Currently, i am in the process of contacting his boss (nor arian Binti Sama) to request a full refund. 🤞🏼"

I granted remote access although I felt uncomfortable and he started running diagnostic tests on my computer. He then asked for my name, billing address, email and phone number which I thought they should already have. I divulged everything excerpt for my billing address. I then called Microsoft to verify while they had remote access to my computer...I managed to abort the connection when they tried  install something on my computer by accepting risks.

hhoyeex (instagram),,"I've seen this a lot of times recently, this is the third time a friend of mine was impersonated, all on instagram. The first time, it was my boyfriend's mother (her instagram username was xxxx, they changed it to caroline_teo???), the next time it was a friend i haven't spoken to in ages (Amanda?? to amandaa??) and the third time, was a girl i hadn't spoken to in awhile as well (hoyeex to hhoyeex). These are really common, and they often choose usernames that are really similar, and difficult to detect if they are false. Of course, this is partially due to the accounts being public, thus letting them copy the pictures. The first time they asked for my phone number (i gave it because i thought it really was my boyfriend's mum), and asked if i could give my bank account details and click an SMS link. Thankfully, my account is a uk number, and thus i did not receive it- i do not think the message could send. I thus kept the conversation going to try and figure the identity of the scammer, but all i managed to get was that he spelled singapore as sinapur, and was thus likely from india (their cities spell 'pore' as 'pur'). The second time they did not message me, and the third time, they asked for my phone number (i gave the police number), of which they said they sent an sms code to it, and asked me to send it to them to verify. As i 'played' with them to try and get more information since it was evidently a scam, they accidentally typed some words in romanian, and deleted it a few seconds later. I tried to continue the conversation but they ignored me afterwards. No money was lost in any of these three situations, but the cases really are on the rise, so i thought it'd be nice to perhaps inform and warn more people of such scams. Thanks!"

Alex russo,601133629869,"I met this man through a dating app and he was very kind and sweet at first. He said he was based in an offshore island in Malaysia and was relocating to Singapore. After a month of texting and phone conversations (he said he was unable to do video calls because his phone could not support it in the offshore island), he called me one day sounding ANXIOUS- the day that he was supposed to come to Singapore. He said that the officers had increase his income tax and he had to pay 9000 ringgit. He asked me if I could help him to transfer USD$2000. He said once he comes to Singapore, he will return the money. Feeling bad and also, hoping to see him, I foolishly sent SGD$1000 (I could not afford more than that). But he did not come that day as he claimed that the process to clear his taxes took long. He said that he will come to Singapore the next day instead. Again, he called and this time said he needed money to pay for the chopper (mode of transportation from the offshore island to KL) and to transport his machines too. This time, i was a bit more wary and said I could not afford it. We still continued chatting and I started asking him for EVIDENCEs/proof. He became very defensive and angry that I did not trust him. I said if he wanted me to lend him money to provide proof but until the hand, he sounded very defensive and rude. He also sent a fake us passport profile once but I was able to see through the scam now after being so stupid. I blocked him from then. I did ask him to return my money but I have yet to receive. I hope this incident will cause one to be wary- to please not blindly trust those online who are sweet and kind. I found his images on another dating site with another name."

He stated that my phone line will be cut off within the next 2 hours because someone created another number with singtel using my particulars. I was told to contact the chinese investigative bureau, a chinese number, and clarify with them so that my line will not be cut. When i called the chinese investigative bureau, they said that a 57 yo man was swindling money by creating fake accounts under my name and phone number in china, and to be sure that i was no relation to the man, they required me to answer questions while the call was recorded. It made the whole situation seem very real because the fake officer was calling other investigative authorities to bring up my case files, etc. i had to declare with my name, and nric. They asked me personal information on my family and living circumstances. The call ended saying they will continue the investigation and contact me through watsapp, plus i was to update them my location at 5pm and 8pm. I was also not to divulge any of information of the case to anyone or they would be implicated into the investigation. the next day, the fake officer called me again saying they had new evidences of my involvement in the case, they even sent me a certificate of the bank accounts created in hong kong, with my chinese name and nric stated. In order to clear my name of any involvement, i was to either fly to hong kong, paying for my own air ticket, and meet with the officers there, or to transfer money to them and freeze my accounts. Thats when i realised that i was a part of a scam because no official would waste 4 hours of talking to you over the phone and subsequently asking you to transfer money or asking for personal bank details. I hung up saying that i would not transfer any money or reveal my bank accounts. Subsequently, i called the singapore police hotline to make a report."

Jeffery Louis,,Just want to share my story of a scammer who keeps asking me to buy him iTunes cards. At first I didn't think anything amiss and went ahead to purchase it for several times. Later I came across a poster alerting the public about the iTunes gift cards scam. Then I googled this and knew how the scammers cheat people using iTunes card.

We agreed to meet at Jurong east street 13, block 133 at a coffeeshop below the block. After reaching she said she needed another 170 sgd to be transfered to her admin's posb account as she got a penalty from her admin for agreeing to meet me at a earlier timing instead of the timing we fixed earlier on facebook messenger. She had promised to pay me back in cash after we met so i agreed and transfered but right after i transfered she asked me to do a western union transfer to her boss in phillipines whose name is of danica artocilla. She asked me to do a transfer of 250sgd in western union to her boss and she said that fee was to cover her rental in the room she is staying as if she dont pay for room rental, she wont be able to meet me. So i did do a western union transfer to her so called boss in phillipines but after that she kept giving lots of excuses and empty promises of returning me back my money in cash when we meet but i waited for 4 hours but she didnt turn up. That's when i knew i was scammed and made a police report. I transfered a total of 1.3ksgd in total to her in that four hours i waited for her. My advice to everyone is not to fall for this type of scams in facebook where girls claim themselves as escorts offering sexual services. It's all a scam."

When i became suspicous abt his identity, i looked thru his ig profile and notice his photos were few and recently uploaded.

He did NOT ask to meet me or speak with me over phone, but got so CHILDISHLy offended when i asked him for a selfie photo. I suspect this is a scammer who has stolen SOMEONE'S ig account to con PEOPLE. I hv SINCE BLOcked him and unfollowed him. But notice recently his follower group has grown bigger. He might change his name to continue cheating others, so pLEase check out this profile picture and beware."

They told me that if I really had nothing to do with this, I should let the Beijing Seaport Security Authorities know directly.

Park choung oil and gas,827045157073,"Online friend messaged me on april 2019. He claimed that he is Korean and had seen my number on Paktor app. Hence, he is messaging me. He introduced himself as eunjin (+82 7045157073). He is easy to talk with and never fails to message every day. He is always so understanding, comforting, assuring and supportive. It was easy to fall in love with him. He says that the business in the oil sector is bad and he will be going to brunei soon to do a big investment. He says he works for park Choung oil and gas of which he has partner under gs Caltex gas station eunma. He told his mum and sister that he has a girlfriend and his sister wants to meet me. Sister by the name of Veronica claims to be studying medical school in Germany. He flew off to Brunei as planned to start business talks with oil partners to purchase 31000 barrels of oil at $62/ barrel. He said that it is a reasonable price and it is cheaper than Middle East. The total investment is about 2 million dollars. Two days later, he feedback that he is very stressed as government tax is involved and he could not raise the amount required. Amount required was usd$12000. I told him he will have to think of means himself as i do not lend money, especially to a guy that I have never met or video called before in my life. He began to be defensive and used a lot of reverse psychology methods to make you feel guilty. I requested him to produce his identification card, boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, flight reference number from Brunei to Singapore and hotel booking reference number. Unfortunately, he couldn’t give. For boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, he says that he has thrown it away. The passport was confiscated till he made the payment so he couldn’t send me that. As for flight reference number, he couldn’t access his email to find it but kept reiterating that he will fly to Singapore on 26/4/2019. I contacted the hotel name which he gave and was told that no such reservation could be found. Amount was lowered to usd$7000 the next day, but I showed him that my bank account only has 1900 sgd. Today, 26/4/2019, he says that he needs usd$1700. I again told him to send me proof of identification. He says I am stingy and selfish to leave him in the lurch and he is going to suffer from depression because of funds. Many times, he says that because he is shy, he doesn’t dare to ask funds from his business partners and friends, but in my opinion, when you are desperate, you ask everyone, not someone that you have met for 17 days only."
Usman Najib,12132775078,"Met this person online through a dating website called lovehabibi.com. Almost 2 weeks into knowing him, he told me he  bought stuff for me from Dubai since he's there before flying off to Germany. Received a receipt from him but its does't look credible since there were traces of white spaces erased and replaced with details. I received an email shortly and said i had to pay for handling fees since he already paid $2500 for shipping the items. It was $835 and i had to pay immediately for the items to be shipped out from dubai to singapore. It will be transitting from malaysia tgerefore i had to pay that amount to a woman. I emailed back asking why should it be paid to a woman instead of a company. I looked up the website on the email and it came up to an online horse betting platform. I googled his number and i saw information about bitcoin. I immediately realised it was a scam so i did not make any payments at all. I will make a police report soon."

She got a WhatsApp number from a Jessica to msg me and we dealt accordingly - with me transferring 220 over to another PayNow number (Janie). A confirmation was sent and i emailed the hotel to confirm the booking (they took 1 day to reply). The next day, on check-in day, Jessica WhatsApp-ed me to inform that due to a system glitch, my booking was not captured and the hotel would compensate me with a 2-night stay instead if i would agree to change the date. I refused and asked for refund which Jessica said would take 5-7 working days to process. By then, hotel got back and said my booking does not exist at all. I questioned Jessica and she replied ""booking is under 3rd party system that's why hotel couldn't check"" and to wait for my refund. Of course refund didn't come till now and i got scammed."

As I  thought Singapore being a safe country it cannot be a scam. the seller by the name dhdhfh asked me to contact through Whatsapp which i initially hesitated but later as Singapore was a safe country went on with it. he initially offered me a offer that if i buy 3 phones i would get 2 more phones for free. but i insisted that one is sufficient and told i will pay through Lazada. but he insisted me in not going through Lazada as he will not get the full amount. i told how can i believe him without any details. he immediately sent me a NRIC of a Singaporean. i thought it was real and even cross checked the number's originality. It was real, so I paid him. he then told me to pay via bitcoin. I grew suspicious about it. but later he sent bank details of posb 09391661?. I sent $250 to his account and sent a screenshot. he told me that he will deliver the product by the next day. but it never happened. the next day i repeatedly messaged him. finally he responded but saying that i have to pay the customs in order to get the phone. he gave the second account number 438-18545-3 posb account. his name is tan boon leng and he sent me an nric card photo s781797?h. my money is gone and hope he would get caught. i would track his ip address to be 197.210.45.191 with location in Nigeria, as he is using a vpn. and i reported to jurong west police with Report Number: J/20190223/2036."
Donna xuan,,"Basically i saw this girl on FB and she seems cute so i added her. Started saying hi after she accepted my friend request. When she told me she is an escort and ask me if i wanted to meet.  So i said sure why not. She told me her address which was 450 Tampines st 42. I came down there and she told me she can only meet if I transferred $75. After I transferred $75 she asked me to transfer another $150 for the total amount of $200. I was very naive and transfer another $150. When i went down to her void deck that she asked me to, she asked for another $150 for her release fee and told me she would pay back the $150 in cash. But I didn't send her the other $150. I felt like i have been scammed. Lost $200 and almost lost $350 in total."
